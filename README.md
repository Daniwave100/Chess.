# ♟️ Console-Based Chess Game

## 🎯 Background

This is a slightly modified chess game that is played in the console/terminal. I wanted to build something more complex than my previous projects while also deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). This project served as a great learning experience in Java before taking a university course in the language.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- 1️⃣ Run the main class
- 2️⃣ Select and move a piece using the grid coordinate system (e.g., e2, d1, a2)
- 3️⃣ The game ends when the player or bot captures the king piece


## ♜ Chess Piece Logic

- ♙ Pawns – Move one square forward, capture one square diagonally
- ♜ Rooks – Move horizontally or vertically, cannot jump over pieces
- ♞ Knights – Move in an L shape, can jump over pieces
- ♝ Bishops – Move diagonally, cannot jump over pieces
- ♛ Queens – Move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, cannot jump over pieces
- ♚ Kings – Move one square in any direction, capturing the king ends the game

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- ✅ Implement a chess bot engine 🤖
- ✅ Create a GUI using JavaSwing 🖥️
- ✅ Account for advanced chess rules like checkmate, castling, pawn promotion, and en passant 🎯
